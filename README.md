On-off intermittency is a MATLAB routine (version R2019b) that produces the plots of the distribution of the off phases and the power spectral density. 

The repository contains:
- the script generate_plots_distribution_off_phases, that produces the above mentioned plots;
- the function compute_delta_varying, that computes the host and parasitoid population when the grazing parameter delta randomically varies;
- the function compute_r_varying, that computes the host and parasitoid population when the host growth rate r randomically varies;
- the function distribution_off_phases, that computes the probability density function of the distribution of the off phases.


The routine has been implemented and developed by Angela Monti. It can be used under the conditions of CC-BY-NC 2.0

A full description of the model is available in:
